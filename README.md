# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Game

A clean and interactive **Tic Tac Toe** game built using **React**. <br />
This project is my first hands-on React application, inspired by the official **React.dev** tutorial. I previously built this game using **vanilla JavaScript**, and recreating it in React helped me understand component structure, props, state management, and time-travel debugging.
